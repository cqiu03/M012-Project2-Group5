# Group5 - Multi-Armed Bandit Problem Project
For running the function:

We are inputting the number of trials and the statistics of regret and happiness for each cafeteria
to change the number of trials, the user must change the t value in the parentheses in line 139 in the simulate function to the number of trials they want to run then run the program
the output will give the optimum happiness, the expected values for happiness and regret for each function and the simulation values for average happiness and regret for each function based on the number of trials
